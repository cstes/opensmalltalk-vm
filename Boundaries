In my world I learn from those that have things to teach me.
I like beautiful music, complex or simple, not dumbed down pop.
A world that caters only to beginners contains no bicyclists, no bicycles,
only clumsy things with training wheels.  It is a world that does not teach
skills, but avoids them in the mistaken belief that the short term hurt of
falling off a bicycle is not worth the long term benefit of efficient personal
transport. If people want to live in such a world I can't stop them, but I
am a cyclist. I won't live with training wheels.  I am unreasonable enough to
expect those that want to cycle will want to do it properly.
